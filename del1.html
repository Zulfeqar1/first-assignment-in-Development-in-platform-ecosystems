                    <h3>DRTP</h3><p>This project is about sending data from one device to another over a distance, and it can be done in two ways: either using UDP or TCP. Through this project, we can also analyze how much data is sent, the bandwidth used, as well as the time it takes for different data structures to be transferred.</p>
